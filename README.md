## Features

### 1. Application
- Generate Synthetic Data: Create custom datasets with specified characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
- Upload Dataset: Drag and drop your CSV files into the app for analysis and modeling.

### 2. Algorithm Education
- Interactive discussions and explanations of machine learning algorithms, focusing on Linear Regression.

### 3. Model Implementation
- Upload a dataset, select target columns, and train a linear regression model.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
- Download the trained model as a `.pkl` file for future use.
